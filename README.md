Files : 

  - Simann :  is a function that receives a problem object with cost, propose_move, compute_delta_cost, accept_move and display method.
  - main : The TSP class is created it's a problem object designed with the method described above.
  
It's runned in the main file, the size of the TSP problem can be specify at the bottom with prob = TSP(n)
